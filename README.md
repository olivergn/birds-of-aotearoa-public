# Birds of Aotearoa
> A full-stack web app for managing a database of New Zealand birds.

## General information
This project was developed as part of my second year coursework at the University of Otago, studying backend web development. It uses an Express.js/EJS stack to provide an interface to manage a MySQL database of New Zealand bird species. While I have kept the repository private for academic integrity concerns, the source code is available to prospective employers upon request.

## Features
- RESTful Express.js routing supports a full range of HTTP requests for managing birds by ID.
- EJS templates and partials render server-side HTML dynamically.
- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) support for all standard operations on the MySQL database.
- The program is fully containerised with Docker for cross-platform deployment.

## Technologies used
